# AutoUSB-Backup
This PowerShell script quickly backs up files from selected user folders to a USB drive based on its label. It only transfers files smaller than 10MB, ensuring a fast operation. The process is optimized to allow the user to insert the USB drive, perform the backup, and eject it within seconds â€” ideal for quick, on-the-go "backups".
